Banking simulation system created in Python and Django with more than 1,000 lines of code, with a purpose to allow users to utilize financial actions such as deposits, withdrawals, and checking balances. The simulation utilized Python functions to deliver a clear, and easily readable banking operations, such as error handling from incorrect inputs and ensuring precise calculations within transaction boundaries. I implemented the system on a Django-based web interface to ensure a convenient user experience, combining HTML for the front-end design and Python for back-end functions. This project helped me improve my abilities in web development, object-oriented programming, and database management. I also obtained knowledge in developing user-friendly interfaces and implementing strong data validation, improving the platform's functionality and usability. This project enhanced my knowledge of Python and Django, while also improving my skills in problem-solving and attention to detail.
