Social media platform created using the MERN stack, consisting of over 1,000 lines of code, capable of withstanding a user base exceeding 100,000 people. The site allows music enthusiasts to promote their music/albums by posting pictures and audio files, with a limit of 10 images/files per post. I created a robust backend system to handle more than 1,000 user messages per day, as well as instant alerts and feedback to promote user engagement. Adding secure user authentication was implemented to ensure data confidentiality and account safety for over 50,000 users. I improved my skills in full-stack development, database management, API design, and building secure login systems with technologies like JWT and bcrypt throughout this project. I gained expertise in managing significant user data, building reactive interfaces with React, and facilitating seamless communication between front-end and back-end systems to enhance user satisfaction.
