Responsive shopping cart mobile app created in React Native. This app is capable of handling more than 10,000 users, and ensures that the users can efficienity, and effectively buy and list items for sale, while having a secure payment transaction. The app has over five Redux actions for state control, allowing smooth browsing and user experience. I created more than ten interactive animations and personalized elements, such as the login, logout, and registration pages, along with real-time progress bars for purchase forms so the user can see how much of the form has been completed. The design of the user interface was created to be attractive and uncluttered, featuring responsive elements and easy-to-use navigation bars to enhance user experience. This project helped me improve my skills in React Native and Redux, enhanced my knowledge of incorporating animations and dynamic UI components, and provided me with hands-on experience in integrating secure payment gateways. This encounter improved my abilities in front-end development, state management, and providing user-centered design solutions.
